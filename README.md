# Set: The card game

### Description
Set is a captivating card game designed with vanilla JavaScript, where the objective is to detect sets from a 4x3 grid of cards. A set is defined as three cards where for each attribute, they are either all identical or completely unique. Your skills are put to the test as the game operates on a timer and even keeps track of your high scores, saving them locally!

When no sets are available on the table, it intelligently adds an additional row of cards.
